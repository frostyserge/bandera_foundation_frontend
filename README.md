# Brief description of the project and its purpose:

In 2014 russia annexed Ukrainian Crimea and a part of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Ukrainian Armed Forces were in bad shape after 25 years of total corruption so the people of Ukraine came together
and started volunteering to help their army as much as they could and a whole volunteer movement started ever since that contributed to the Ukranian defense capabilities. But at that time the army was 
fighting against mostly russia backed separatists and only in the eastern part of Ukraine which was happening on roughly 5% of the Ukrainian territory.

On February 24, 2022 russia launched an unprovoked full-scale war against Ukraine. It treacherously invaded the Ukrainian free country and wanted to destroy everything that was Ukrainian.
This war could be compared with the biblical story of the battle between a shepherd David, that had only a rock and a sling and Goliath, who had armor, shield and a sword.

This was the time when the Ukrainian people needed even more help, the Ukrainian Army was in need in more equipment, uniform and other supplies in order to fight back such a monster like the russian war machine.
This was the time when a small charity organisation "Bandera Foundation" has been founded in order to increase even more help for the Ukrainian people. 

This project's mission is to help this organization to have a better presense on the web and to attract more donors and volunteers to help a good cause.
