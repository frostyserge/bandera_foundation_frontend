                Bandera foundation is a non-profit organization that was founded
                by a group of friends, Ukrainians by origin, who could not stand
                aside when a full-scale invasion began. The organization works
                towards helping Ukrainian defenders. Our mission is to act fast
                and effectively to deliver humanitarian aid personally to the
                front lines, skipping unnecessary logistic steps. Flying to
                Poland, transporting all essentials to Ukraine, and meeting
                personally with people affected by war provides us with the most
                accurate information about current needs. The founders cover all
                operational expenses. 100% of the profit goes towards the cause.
